# Geography MCQ-Questions Generator
---

The name of this repository itself is self-explanatory for what the project is about, yes, it's a mcq-questions generator.
Well, the program is quite simple and it doesn't involve any calculations.
From a programmer's perspective, it's just playing with **I/O**.

Nevertheless, let me give you an introduction about what's going on in this program.
So, we basically are just reading a data file, here it's `data.txt`,
and storing the name of the city and its captital to a dictionary, mapped accordingly.
We then create a bunch of variables inside a function for generating and
storing our answers to the question and also making the options random and unique.
Then, all the questions and options are appended to a file - `MCQ-Questions.txt`,
with each entry to the loop and answers are stored in a seperate file - `Answers.txt`.
The files are created if it's not already there.

# Installation

Clone this repository or download the zip file.
And simply, run the codeFile.py. It then creates two new files as mentioned above.
You'll know which one is which.

> Yup, I do share your view regarding this being a naive approach for this and I should've worked with less variables,
this was all how my stupid brain could approach to this problem in the time of writing,
I definately will go through this program at least once later to see if there's a better approach to this - to which there definately is.
Will be happy to receive your thoughts on this.
